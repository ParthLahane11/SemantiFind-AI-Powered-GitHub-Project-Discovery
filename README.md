SemantiFind – AI-Powered GitHub Project Discovery
SemantiFind is a semantic search tool designed to help users discover open-source GitHub projects that align with specific topics, domains, and potential licensing interests. Leveraging state-of-the-art language models and vector search (FAISS), the system enables natural language queries like:

"Top 7 most popular projects in DevOps"
"Find Python projects related to medical imaging"
"Most starred AI projects in healthcare"

🚀 Features
🔍 Natural Language Querying
Search for GitHub repositories using intuitive, flexible queries.

💡 Semantic Search with Sentence Transformers
Embeddings powered by all-MiniLM-L6-v2.

⚡ Fast Retrieval with FAISS
High-performance approximate nearest neighbor search for large-scale datasets.

📊 Enriched Metadata
Each project includes name, description, domain, language, and popularity indicators (e.g., stars).
